    Library to generate random passwords and check password strength.

    The `NotQwerty123.RandomPassword` module generates a random password
    with letters, digits and punctuation characters.

    The `NotQwerty123.PasswordStrength` module provides checks that the
    password is not too easy to guess. These checks check that the password
    is long enough, it contains at least one digit and one punctuation
    character, and it is not similar to any common passwords.
